# HabitNexus

HabitNexus is a Flask-based productivity and peer-accountability platform built for engineering students. It combines daily routine tracking, DSA preparation, LeetCode progress, analytics, friends, challenges, leaderboards, notifications, and a protected developer console in one workspace.

The project started as a personal/resume project and is being upgraded toward a production-ready student platform.

## Key Features

- Student authentication with username, email, or public Student ID login.
- Password reset using registered email and Student ID.
- Unique public Student ID format such as `username_4821`.
- Daily routine tracking saved by date, including previous-day history.
- Calendar view for historical routine progress.
- Analytics dashboard for habit completion, consistency, DSA growth, and recent activity.
- DSA tracker with topic targets, pending topics, CSV export, and LeetCode sync.
- Friends hub with privacy-aware user search by Student ID.
- Friend requests, friend profiles, challenges, and weekly leaderboard.
- Public profile preview for unconnected users with limited profile-only data.
- Full profile view for connected friends.
- Notification center with account notifications, AI coach reminders, and developer pinned notices.
- Protected developer console for user management, growth metrics, landing-page content, contact details, suggestions, and pinned notifications.
- Public landing page with prototype showcase metrics, developer-managed updates, contact details, and suggestion form.
- PostgreSQL support for production with SQLite fallback for local development.

## AI Feature

HabitNexus currently uses an in-app AI-style study coach notification system. It does not require an external AI provider or API key.

The AI coach:

- Looks at today's pending routines.
- Generates a focused reminder with a motivational quote.
- Shows the notification on the dashboard and notification center.
- Allows each user to dismiss the generated AI notification for that day.
- Stores dismissed generated notifications in `notification_dismissals`.

Developer pinned notifications are different from AI coach notifications. They are created and managed only from the developer console and cannot be removed by normal users.

```

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd HabitNexus
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app locally.

```bash
python3 app.py
```

By default, local development uses SQLite through `database.db`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or configure these variables on your hosting platform.

```bash
APP_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-long-random-secret
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://habitnexus_user:password@host:5432/habitnexus
DATABASE_SSLMODE=require
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=1
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV` | Set to `production` in production environments. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Required in production for secure Flask sessions. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string. If omitted, SQLite is used. |
| `DATABASE_SSLMODE` | PostgreSQL SSL mode, commonly `require` on hosted databases. |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | Set to `1` when the app runs behind HTTPS. |
| `SQLITE_DATABASE` | Optional local SQLite database path. Defaults to `database.db`. |

## Production and PostgreSQL

HabitNexus uses PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` is set. Without `DATABASE_URL`, it falls back to SQLite for local development.

Initialize PostgreSQL tables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database" python3 -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"
```

Migrate existing SQLite data to PostgreSQL:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database" python3 scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py --sqlite database.db --replace
```

Run with Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

The included `Procfile` is intended for platforms such as Render.

## Render Deployment Checklist

- Add a PostgreSQL database on Render.
- Set `DATABASE_URL` from the Render PostgreSQL connection string.
- Set `APP_ENV=production`.
- Set a strong `SECRET_KEY`.
- Set `DATABASE_SSLMODE=require`.
- Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=1`.
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` as the build command.
- Use `gunicorn app:app` as the start command.
- Do not rely on `database.db` in production.

| --- | --- |
| `users` | Student accounts, profile data, developer flag, public Student ID. |

| `friends` | Connected user relationships. |
| `activities` | Recent activity feed data. |
| `notifications` | User account notifications. |

## Privacy Model

- Users are searched by public Student ID instead of listing every user publicly.
- Before connection, another student can only see limited profile information such as name, college, and bio.
- DSA details, personal links, and deeper progress data are reserved for connected friends.
- Developer users are visible as official platform accounts.
- Developer pinned notifications are managed only by the developer console.

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with Werkzeug.
- CSRF tokens are required for POST forms.
- Flask session cookies are configured as HTTP-only.
- Production mode requires `SECRET_KEY`.
- Profile uploads are limited by extension, MIME type, and size.
- Developer routes are protected by an `is_developer` account flag.
- Normal users cannot deactivate developer accounts.

## External Integrations

### LeetCode GraphQL

HabitNexus syncs public LeetCode profile data using LeetCode's GraphQL endpoint:

```text
https://leetcode.com/graphql
```

This is used to verify usernames and store daily solved-count history.

### ApexCharts

The frontend uses ApexCharts for dashboard, analytics, leaderboard, and developer-console charts.

## Useful Commands

Run locally:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Run production server locally:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

Check Python syntax:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile app.py database.py
```

Initialize database:

```bash
python3 -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"
```

Migrate SQLite to PostgreSQL:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database" python3 scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py --sqlite database.db --replace
```

## Current Roadmap Ideas

- Add email-based password reset tokens instead of Student ID based local reset.
- Add stronger admin audit logs for developer actions.
- Add automated tests for authentication, privacy rules, and friend workflows.
- Add API-style JSON endpoints if a mobile app or SPA frontend is planned.
- Add background jobs for scheduled notifications and LeetCode sync.
- Add rate limiting for login, password reset, and user search.
